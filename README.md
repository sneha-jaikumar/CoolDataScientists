Our heart failure prediction dataset consists of 12 features that can be analyzed to predict mortality by heart failure so patients can receive proper care early on.

Plot Conclusions:
Individuals with a higher creatinine phosphokinase level tend to have an increased mortality rate. However, these individuals are also likely to not have high blood pressure. Those who smoke have a lower ejection fraction, whereas those who do not smoke have a higher level of serum creatinine, yet higher levels of serum creatinine tend to be associated with a greater mortality rate. This led us to the following conclusions: Higher levels of creatinine phosphokinase may seem beneficial in that it does not indicate high blood pressure, but this could also serve as a risk for potential heart failure. Similarly, those who do not smoke tend to have a higher level of serum creatinine, but this also serves as a risk for potential heart failure.
